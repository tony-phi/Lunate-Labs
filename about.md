Lunate Labs builds healthtech that enhances healthspan by closing the “clinical gap” in rehab technology.
We serve as an implementation sandbox for change management, derisking digital transformation and improving adoption in healthcare settings.

The “Scar L” mark is derived from a real scar, symbolizing healing, humanity, and nonlinear progress. It embodies thoughtful design and the intersection of technology and recovery.

This is the start of our website.
